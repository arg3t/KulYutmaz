KulYutmaz is a project developed for the regional TUBITAK competition's programming field. It aims to create a more advanced phishing e-mail detection algorithm using website content checking and a neural network that we have trained. For more information, you may read the project report in the repository (Unfortunately it is only available in Turkish).
